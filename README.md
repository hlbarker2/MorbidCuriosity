## Purpose
Analyze United States Mortality and Demographic Data to identify patterns in deaths in the United States. The hope with this project is that it sheds light on areas of concern in the United States that can be addressed by public health professionals to help Americans live longer and healthier lives.

## Data
The data we are pulling is from the CDCâ€™s social vulnerability index and wonder (health) dataset. Our repository is located at this [link](https://github.com/hlbarker2/MorbidCuriosity).

## Methods

* ETL
* DB on AWS
* Flask app built with HTML/CSS, JS
* D3.js
* Leaflet.js
* Chart.js

## Visualizations

Our team is planning to visualize mortality data in three different ways. 

First, we will use a heat map of deaths in the United States by county for a given year. There will be a drop-down option where you can look at different health-related causes of death, like heart disease or cancer, and the map will reflect in a new heat map to show where those causes of death impacted Americans most. We are starting with this to give an overview of all the data we are exploring. 

Then, we will be digging into some indicators related to the counties with the highest percent of deaths and the lowest percent of deaths. The indicators could be average income in the county and population, or perhaps accessibility to a hospital. 

The third visualization we will create is a radar chart that shows the top 6 causes of death in the whole country, and compares two different people and how susceptible they are to each of these. The two comparisons could be Low vs High education level, or male vs female.
